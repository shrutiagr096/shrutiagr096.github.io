	<h1>All about me...</h1>
	<p>
I comes from a family that has produced three generations of engineers.I decided to follow in the footsteps 
    of my father and brother and made up my mind to study at IIT Kanpur. My hard work paid off and I got admission 
    into the premier institute.</p>
  <p>Engineering apart, I have varied interests. I like reading, and creative writing and have written for the
    Hindustan Times. I have also obtained a senior diploma in Bharatnatyam. </p>
